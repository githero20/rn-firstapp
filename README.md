# A Task manager app built with React Native.

## Description

This is my first React Native project and a version of the first project in the React Native - The Practical Guide (2022) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on [Udemy] (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/).

It is a simple task manager app, built entirely with React Native.
